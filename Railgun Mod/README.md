# Railgun Mod
This is basically a dueling mod, but there's a "railgun" launch pad on the map. You have a button that turns green when you go onto the launch area of the pad. When pressed, you get centered and then launched down range.
There is also a button that puts you in the hit-zone at the end of the pad. If you are the one hosting, you can give players a variety of Nerd69420's awesome OP ships for more mass.
I like to take one of those and then sit in the hit-zone to bounce the other players off.
