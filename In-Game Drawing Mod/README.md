# In-Game Drawing Mod
In this mod, you are a pencil drawing in space!
There is a draw button, a clear button, an undo button, a size button, a color button, and a shape button.
Currently there are 12 colors to choose from, 14 sizes, and 5 shapes.
You draw by holding down the **draw button** and flying around, or placing single dots by just pressing it once.
The **clear button** clears everything you have drawn, but leaves everyone elses. If you are hosting and want to clear everyones drawings, there's a clear-all function you can run.
The **undo button** removes the last dot placed by the user. You can hold it down to quickly remove larger portions.
The **size button** flips between sizes, the **color button** flips between white, grey, black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, and pink, and the shape button flips between circle, square, star, triangle, and heart.
There does get to be a lot of lag as the drawing amount expands, but you can get a lot out of it before having to clear everything if you spread out across the map instead of drawing everything in one place. There's **ban/unban** functions if you need them. They don't kick the player from the game though, they just clear their art and stop them from drawing. The ban is on their name, so if they rejoin with a different name you'll have to reban them.
### Here's a few examples of art me and Emitytrap/partytime0181 made
