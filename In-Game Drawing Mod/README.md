# In-Game Drawing Mod
In this mod, you are a pencil drawing in space!
There is a draw button, a clear button, an undo button, a size button, and a color button.
Currently there are 10 colors to choose from, and 14 sizes.
I will probably add more shapes to draw with in the future, but for now there is only a circle drawing tool. You draw by holding down the **draw button** and flying around, or placing single dots by just pressing it once.
The **clear button** clears everything you have drawn, but leaves everyone elses. If you are hosting and want to clear everyones drawings, there's a clear-all function you can run.
The **undo button** removes the last dot placed by the user. You can hold it down to quickly remove larger portions.
The **size button** flips between sizes, and the **color button** flips between white, black, red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, and pink.
There does get to be a lot of lag as the drawing amount expand, so you will probably need to clear them somewhat often.
