# Mothership-Mayhem
This mod is kinda a spin-off on DTM, but it's just motherships, and there's 10 abilities to choose from. Each ability has a cooldown time of 15 seconds.
It is also multi-round, so you don't have to rehost every time someone wins. 
The code could definitely be improved, but this is the best version I've made so far.
