# Mothership-Mayhem
This mod is kinda a spin-off on DTM, but it's just motherships, and there's 10 abilities to choose from. Each ability has a cooldown time of 15 seconds.
It is also multi-round, so you don't have to rehost every time someone wins. 
The code could definitely be improved, but this is the best version I've made so far. \

*There's a problem with this mod where it will do a weird type of crash where it reloads the page and takes you back to the starblast home page. Idk why it does this, so I can't fix it unfortunately.*
