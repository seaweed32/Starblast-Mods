# Asteroid Dodge mod
I bet you can't guess what you do in this mod!\
\
You are in an arena-ish place, and every second a red arrow pops up somewhere and an asteroid (it's actually 5) flys down through that place. If you get hit by it there's a good chance it will knock you out of the arena.
When you get knocked out, you teleport back to the center.
## The original
In the original, you can set how many players are needed to play in the code, which is also the max amount of players. You can also set the rate at which the asteroids fire via fireRate, as well as the length of the rounds.
The lowest score wins, and every time you get hit out of the arena you gain a point, so don't get hit!

## v2
In v2 you you can only set the length of the rounds. This is because there is no max player limit, and the game starts at 2 players. 
You start the game with 500 points, and every second you loose a point. This is good because the lowest score wins. You gain 5 points if you get hit out of the arena.
Also, the rate of fire of the asteroids decreases (or does it increases? idk but it gets faster) by 0.1 second every 30 seconds. 
Plus there's emotes in it. Really v2 is just better but I thought I should at least add the original since you can change the ROF.
