# Hyperspeed Generator
If you haven't already figured it out, this is a hyperspeed generator mod!
Obviously, you could just go into the modding terminal and set a ships velocity to a very large number, but the problem with that is that for some reason it won't appear like you're moving at all in game.
So that means to achieve **TRUE HYPERSPEED** you have to get a bit creative. This mod has gives you a ship with -2500 mass. This negative mass means that you're pulled to whatever you touch instead of being pushed away.
It uses that to get you up to some extreme speeds by placing you at the sun and spawning 300 level 3 sausers on top of you.
### Here's a video of the hyperspeed

As you can see, it launches you so fast that it black-screens your game. Then it displays your speed.
For reference, an A-Speedster moves at a max speed of 4.6vu (velocity units), and an X-3 moves at a max of 5.2vu.
### This is the fastest speed I've ever gotten using this mod.

9.9e+231 is roughly nine hundred quinseptuagintillion, or 900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
so quite a bit faster than the X-3!

### Glitched lasers
This happens somethimes if it doesn't succeed in getting you to unfathomable speeds, but still get you going enough to mess with the games mechanics.
It's a pretty nice effect, although you have basically no control over the ship at that point.
